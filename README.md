> :construction: Project in early development

This project contains all required components to deploy a ready to use `Valheim` game server. I made my best effort to had a secure configuration, but I can make mistakes. Review the configuration by yourself.

If you use this software for commercial purposes, please consider making a donation or a horde of bloodthirsty vikings led by Odin will fall on you.

## Requirements

The only requirement you need to have installed in your system in order to deploy a fully functional game server is [`Ansible`](https://www.ansible.com/). If you do not have it, please install it in order to continue.
Note that at this time, the game server only supports [`Ubuntu`](https://ubuntu.com/) as base operating system. Choose a Ubuntu compatible cloud provider.
