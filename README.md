> :construction: Project in early development

This project contains all required components to deploy a ready to use `Valheim` game server. I made my best effort to had a secure configuration, but I can make mistakes. Review the configuration by yourself. At this moment it only supports Ubuntu as base operating system.

If you use this software for commercial purposes, please consider making a donation or a horde of bloodthirsty vikings led by Odin will fall on you.

## Requirements

You need to have [`Ansible`](https://www.ansible.com/) installed on your system. If you do not have it, please install it in order to continue.
